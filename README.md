# Deep Learning Spring 2023 - FinalProject

## Authors: Richard Fu, Nico Colosso, Lenox Hsu

We have developed an LSTM audio
generation model for the Classical Piano MIDI dataset us-
ing three LSTM layer blocks and two fully connected layers,
which yields a 2.475 perplexity score and produces realistic
melodic samples.

Sample output is provided in the `out.mid` and `out.wav` files.
